# Portfolio Website

**⚠️ Warning: This website is still under construction and may change frequently.** 
Please pardon any inconsistencies or incomplete sections as I continue to refine the design and content.

This is a personal portfolio website built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) to showcase my projects, skills, and experience. The site features a responsive design, a dynamic content section, and a mobile-friendly navbar with a hamburger menu.

## Live Demo

Visit the live site on GitHub Pages: [https://kakarot98.github.io/portfolio/](https://kakarot98.github.io/portfolio/)

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to a range of screen sizes, from mobile devices to larger desktop screens.
- **Mobile-Friendly Navbar:** On smaller screens, the navbar collapses into a hamburger menu for easy navigation.
- **Dynamic Sections:** Content sections (such as About, Education, Experience, Skills, Projects, and Contact) are loaded dynamically via React Router.
- **Vite + React Stack:** Fast development environment, quick builds, and simple deployment steps.
<!-- 
## Screenshots

To illustrate the layout and responsiveness, screenshots are stored in the `screenshots` directory. For example:

- Desktop View:

  ![Desktop View](./screenshots/desktop-view.png)

- Mobile View with Hamburger Menu:

  ![Mobile View](./screenshots/mobile-view.png)

*(Note: Place your screenshot images in the `screenshots` folder at the root of your project. Update the image paths and filenames as needed.)* -->
